# AI_BicepCurlCounter
This Bicep Curl Counter Project is based on AI based human pose estimation using MediaPipe, OpenCV and Python. It's like your virtual real time personal trainer making you aware of accuarate range of motion. 

The counter remains inactive if the bicep curl's movement falls between 40 and 160 degrees. Consequently, in order to activate the timer, the user must perform complete curls and extensions, covering the full range of motion for their biceps.
